## 📋 NEXT STEPS

### 1. Add Routes to App.js
Need to add these routes with role-based protection:

```javascript
// Seed Producer routes
<Route path="seed-batches" element={<SeedBatches />} />
<Route path="seed-inventory" element={<SeedInventory />} />

// Farmer routes
<Route path="farm-management" element={<FarmManagement />} />

// Trader routes
<Route path="buy-from-farmers" element={<BuyFromFarmers />} />
<Route path="trader-inventory" element={<TraderInventory />} />

// Processor routes
<Route path="processing-records" element={<ProcessingRecords />} />

// Consumer routes
<Route path="purchase-history" element={<PurchaseHistory />} />

// Admin routes
<Route path="users" element={<UserManagement />} />
```

### 2. Update Navigation (Navbar.js)
Add role-specific links:

**Seed Producer sees:**
- Seed Batches
- Seed Inventory

**Farmer sees:**
- Farm Management
- Register Product

**Trader sees:**
- Buy from Farmers
- My Inventory

**Processor sees:**
- Processing Records

**Consumer sees:**
- Purchase History

**Admin sees:**
- Users (already added!)

### 3. Create Role-Based Dashboard Widgets
Each dashboard should show different stats based on user type.

### 4. Backend Integration
Connect these pages to Django API endpoints:
- Create seed batch API
- Purchase transaction API
- Processing records API
- User management API
